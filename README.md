# Welcome to my Blog!

Hi! I'm Kian Mehta, a grade 12 student exploring Math through these blogs. I recently took a math course with Harvard University, and which pretty much blew my tiny mind. Now, I am writing about what I learned, in a way that's aimed to help you understand even with no specialized knowledge in the field. I hope you enjoy!
